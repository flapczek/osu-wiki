3. Team names may consist of 3 to 20 characters with acronyms of 2 to 4 letters along with a team photo.
4. Inappropriate pictures, names, and/or acronyms are subject to change at the discretion of administration.
5. Teams must have members all either residing within or with profile flags within the same region.
6. Teams will exclusively be scheduled based on their region and not their actual place of residence.
7. There will be three regions for this tournament:
   - The Americas and East Pacific Islands (Americas).
   - Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA).
   - Asia, Australia, and Oceania (AAO).
8. The Americas includes North America, South America, and any island nations, territories, or other dominions east of the International dateline and west of North and South America.
9. EMEA includes Europe, Africa, and the Middle East.
10. All countries listed in the Middle East region may only play for EMEA teams despite some of these countries being included in the list of Asian countries.
    - Kazakhstan is listed as part of Europe but may only play for AAO due to its timezone and the majority of the country being in Asia.
    - AAO includes Asia, and most of Oceania.
    - Hawaii, the Cook Islands, and French Polynesia are excluded from AAO as they are all east of the international dateline and thus fall under the Americas.
    - Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan are part of EMEA rather than AAO as they fall west of the Caspian Sea and have timezones closer to EMEA than AAO.
11. Players from Russia may register for teams from either EMEA or AAO, but they will be scheduled according to the overall team region.

### Qualifier procedure

1. Teams shall have their own lobby freely scheduled by themselves on the [website](https://rescup.xyz/), and run by the [Corsace bot](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/29191632).
2. Last lobby for Qualifiers round cannot start after June 1st 15:00 UTC.
3. If a team does not show up to their scheduled Qualifiers lobby, they may play in any other lobby.
4. Each map will be played in order as they are shown on the mappool sheet. There will be one playthrough of the pool.
5. 90 second timers are used for teams to swap members and ready up.
6. Teams complete registration by playing qualifiers.
7. Rosters are locked after play. Changes are not allowed under any circumstance.
8. Due to this process, teams with players who are screened out will be disqualified from the tournament.
9. Top 32 seeded teams using Z-sum, scaled between 0 and 100, will proceed to Bracket Stage.

### Bracket stage procedure

1. A referee will create a match 10 minutes prior to match time.
2. Captains are expected to be online at least 5 minutes before the scheduled match time to receive invites from referees.
3. Teams are expected to show up on time and prepare for their matches.
4. Teams that fail to field a roster 10 minutes after the scheduled match time will forfeit.
   - In case of both teams failing to show up in time, the match may be rescheduled to a different time.
   - If no suitable time can be arranged, the team with higher seeding will be given the advantage.
5. There are no warmups.
6. There are no restrictions on picks or bans.
7. No Fail is enforced on all maps.
8. Captains will `!roll` in matches. The winner may choose between pick or ban order, and the other captain may choose the remaining order.
9. Teams have 1 ban in Round of 32 and Round of 16, and 2 bans throughout the rest of bracket stage.
   - Ban order is ABAB, with all bans happening at the start of the match.
10. Teams have 90 seconds to declare picks and bans.
11. If a team takes more time than allotted for any of the above actions, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
    - First occurrence: A 30-second extension is given along with a verbal warning.
    - On subsequent occurrences: A random map will be chosen from the mappool using `!roll X`, where X is the number of beatmaps remaining in the mappool.
12. Teams have 90 seconds to swap teammates and lock in their roster.
13. If a team takes more time than allotted for either action, the procedures adopted will be as follows:
    - First occurrence: A 15-second extension is given along with a verbal warning.
    - On subsequent occurrences: the referee will issue the `!mp start 10` command.

### Disconnections

1. In the event of a disconnection, an abort/replay may be called if it occurred within the first 30 seconds of the map. Other than that, common sense will be applied. If proof exists of the disconnected player's score, it can be used. If it is at all ambiguous, the player's score is considered void.
2. Disconnections are considered to be unexpected, game-breaking events out of a player's control (i.e. keyboard/tablet/mouse malfunction, system failure, internet disconnect, etc). Offset, background dim, leaderboard presence, etc. ARE NOT considered valid reasons to call for an abort/replay as players should fix these on their own.
